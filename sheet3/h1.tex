   \item Definition of critical density
      \begin{equation}
         \rho_c = \frac{3 }{8\pi G}H_0^2
      \end{equation}
      When $\rho_{M} + \rho_\text{rad} + \rho_{\Lambda} = \rho_c$, it means that there is no curvature contribution, thus the Universe is flat. According to the definition of $\rho_\text{curv}$, it could also mean that $a = \pm \infty$.
   \item Particle horizon, or cosmological horizon, is the maximal distance from which light could traveled to observer since the beginning of the Universe\cite{wiki:partHor}. It is relevant to discussion of the whole Universe. Event horizon is the boundary where events inside cannot affect or be perceived in any ways by outside, e.g.~near a black hole. And it is normally in smaller scale than particle horizon.
